## <a id="initial" >Initial Setup</a>
The first thing you want to do is place down a programmable block on the grid of choice. Click Edit and find the workshop button and search for "Automatic LCDs 2" by MMaster. Subscribe and select the script, then click OK when you are sure it loaded correctly. You can use them on large or small grids as well, using LCD screens, cockpits, control seats, or other blocks that have screens (Button panels, the programmable block itself, etc). This will be explained later.
